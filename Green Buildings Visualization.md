Green Buildings Visualization 
--------------------------

Our investigation into the decision of whether or not to obtain a green
certification contradicts the original report’s findings. In particular,
focusing more on the desired specifications of area, age, and class A
distinction points to the fact that “green” buildings are not, in
itself, a factor that results in higher rent. Further research needs to
be done on building clusters to extract more precise estimates of other
construction considerations.

To start, we filtered out the buildings with less than 10% occupancy.

Below is the table without any filter for size, resulting in the same
figures as the previous report.

Since the building we plan to construct is 250,000 square feet, it would
be appropriate to limit our focus to buildings within the relevant range
of square footage. Below is the table with only buildings with square
footage between 200,000 and 300,000. The difference in median rent for
green and non-green is only $0.84 per square foot, instead of the
previous consultation of $2.60 per square foot.

Therefore, the actual difference in median rent shows that the revenue
generated by the green building is not as strong as the previous report
suggests. Instead of 250,000 square feet multiplied by $2.60 extra in
revenue for the green building ($650,000 per year), the difference in
median rent for the relevant square footage more closely represents
250,000 \* $0.84, which is an additional $210,000 per year, assuming the
difference in rent is solely attributed to green buildings. This means
that the payback period for a green building is much longer than the
predicted 7.7 years from the previous report. There are other potential
confounding factors that could also influence this $0.84 difference in
rent, especially if green buildings are inherently correlated with
certain attributes.

Filtering further for age, since our building will be newly constructed,
it is more relevant to focus on buildings that are less than 10 years
old.

The median rent for non-green buildings is actually much higher than
that for green buildings if filtering for both square footage and age.
Non-green buildings are shown to have a $7.26 advantage over green
buildings, not accounting for other confounding factors.

The previous report’s findings correctly filtered out outliers in terms
of low occupancy but did not consider the relevant range for the desired
building. The focus on newer buildings around 250,000 square feet allows
for a more targeted comparison and reveals that simply comparing green
and non-green buildings as a whole introduces a host of problems due to
the vast range of possible building types.

Age Distribution for Non-Green and Green Buildings
--------------------------------------------------

Green buildings are newer on average than non-green buildings. They are
both positively skewed; however, the non-green distribution looks almost
bimodal. The median is not necessarily be the best indicator, since the
age is concentrated in two separate areas.

Class A and Green Rating
------------------------

Green buildings are more likely to be of Class A rating, which earn a
higher median rent. This could be a problem, since it does not
accurately represent the supposed advantage of green buildings on their
own. It may be possible to earn a high rent without getting a green
rating.

Total Revenue of Non-Green and Green Buildings by Leasing Rate
--------------------------------------------------------------

We calculated leasing rate, or occupancy rate, divided by 100, to obtain
a decimal value; then, we multiplied by rent (per square foot) to get
total revenues per square foot the company can gain. We explored the
relationship between leasing rate and total revenues. From a revenue
perspective, the green building does not have a distinct advantage over
non-green buildings. In addition, in our sample, the non-green buildings
have a larger market than green buildings when the leasing rate is less
than 50%. Furthermore, we know the cost of constructing a green building
is higher than that of non-green buildings.

The graph below gives a clearer quantitative comparison of the total
revenue by different leasing(occupancy) rates.

Issues with Clusters
--------------------

The rent for each cluster has a wide range, and may possibly represent
regional differences in rent. In addition, there is no information in
the data set for the location of the clusters. As such, we are not able
to pinpoint exactly what rent we could expect to charge since it varies
so much across clusters. Further, the distribution is positively skewed;
we don’t know which side of the distribution the rent we charge would be
on. It would be useful to gather location information on the clusters so
that the analysis could compare buildings local to our planned
construction site.

Issues with Utility Costs
-------------------------

Although gas costs are mostly concentrated around the same level,
electricity costs have wild variation. Again, without knowing the
specific location, we cannot know how the electricity and gas costs will
factor into the rent.

![](Exercise_1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)![](Exercise_1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-23-2.png)

The initial estimate given did not account for many of the variables
that could account for rent for green buildings. In order to make a more
fair comparison and a thorough analysis, more information, especially
about clusters, is needed. But for starters, the comparison should be
made for buildings of the similar size and age. The age distribution is
skewed for both green and non-green buildings, so a simple average will
not suffice. We showed that the Class A rating may be a confounding
variable since most green buildings are Class A. Thus, it may be more
worthwhile to pursue a Class A rating instead since buildings with this
rating have a higher median rent than Class B buildings. Because rents
are highly varied across clusters, and no information is given about the
location of these cluster, we do not know how competitive the rent we
charge would be, or if it is reasonable for our region. Electricity
costs also have a wide range, and it would factor into the rent.
